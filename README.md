- **Data Visualization** – Built interactive **Power BI dashboards** to present key insights.
- **Business Insights & Recommendations** – Provided **actionable strategies** based on the data findings.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Instagram & YouTube outperformed other platforms**, making them ideal for content promotion.
